# Summon Parent

This is a tool intended for children's workers to "summon" parents when needed.  We have it linked within the Mobile App,
so workers can send a text in just a few taps, without revealing the personal phone number of either the parent or the 
volunteer.  Eventually, we hope to integrate this with our pager system, as well. 

A few security checks need to be added to this before it's used in the wild.  Therefore, in the meantime, it will send
text messages to the current user, rather than the intended parent.
