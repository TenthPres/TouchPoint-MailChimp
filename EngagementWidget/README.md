# Engagement Widget

Shows a proportional venn diagram of the three major categories of engagement: Attendance, Membership, and Giving.  This lets you see how these groups
overlap.

## Licensing & Charting
**Summary:** Charting library requires attribution and a free license.  Widget requires remaining open source.  If you don't substantially modify the
code, the defaults will work for you. 

Like the other scripts in this repository, this widget is licensed under [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License).  

TouchPoint's default charting library ([Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/)) does not have a Venn feature, so this widget uses 
[Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) instead.  
**[You need a license to use Highcharts, which is free for nonprofits.](https://shop.highsoft.com/highsoft/form/noncommercialform)**  That license 
allows use under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which means you must credit Highcharts
for the charting library somewhere reasonable.  By default, this is at the bottom right of the widget.
