# TouchPointScripts
This is a collection of scripts, widgets, and other handy bits for use with TouchPoint Software, our ChMS. 

These are all in super-early stage development right now, so tread lightly, but also watch for updates. 

## Tools Under Development

- [**Mailchimp Sync**](mailchimp) - Sync Mailchimp subscribers both ways (from Mailchimp to TouchPoint and vice versa), 
across multiple Mailchimp accounts and with Interests as Subgroups.

- [**GroupMe Sync**](groupme) - GroupMe is where all the cool kids are -- or so says our College Ministry.  Sync ministry 
GroupMes with TouchPoint Organizations.
