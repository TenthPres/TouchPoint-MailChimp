# TouchPointScripts
This is a collection of scripts, widgets, and other handy bits for use with TouchPoint Software, the Church Management 
System we call "MyTenth." 

## Tools Available Now

- [**ChangeLog**](ChangeLog) - This report lists the most recent changes made to a Person or Family.  It shows the person 
making the change, the person to whom the change was made, and the content of the changes.

- [**Email Address Archiving**](EmailAddressArchiving) - TouchPoint can only store two email addresses per user.  While most
people probably only use one or two email addresses at a time, it can be helpful to keep track of all of the email addresses
someone uses across time.  This script allows many more email addresses to be immutably associated with a person's record,
making future data imports significantly less likely to produce duplicates.  This script is strongly encouraged for the 
Mailchimp and ConstantContact integrations. 

- [**Engagement Widget**](EngagementWidget) - Compare your populations of attenders, members, and givers. See how (or if) they
overlap.

- [**Role Checker**](RoleChecker) - Automatically update the roles users have as part of the Morning Batch process.  While
this doesn't remotely handle all the roles, it does handle those that are most important for us and most likely to change.

- [**Sage Intacct**](SageIntacct) - Create a reconciliation report that readily imports into Sage Intacct, as required by
AcctTwo, our accounting firm. 

## Tools Under Development

- [**Mapify**](Mapify) - Wondering which neighborhoods need a new Small Groups?  Or where your attendees actually come from?  See 
people from any search (or org or any other scenario with a Blue Toolbar) on a highly-interactive globe of the world.

- [**PA Background Check Automation**](BackgroundChecks) - Pennsylvania has weird and specific laws about how background 
checks are conducted.  This tool tracks their progress, their renewals, and (so far as we are able within the law) automates 
the process for both staff members and volunteers. 

- [**Mailchimp Sync**](Mailchimp) - Sync Mailchimp subscribers both ways (from Mailchimp to TouchPoint and vice versa), 
across multiple Mailchimp accounts and with Mailchimp Interests as TouchPoint Subgroups.

- [**ConstantContact Sync**](ConstantContact) - Sync ConstantContact subscribers both ways (from ConstantContact to 
TouchPoint and vice versa).
