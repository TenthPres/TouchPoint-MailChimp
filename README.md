# TouchPointScripts
This is a collection of scripts, widgets, and other handy bits for use with TouchPoint Software, our ChMS. 

## Tools Available Now

- [**Email Address Archiving**](EmailAddressArchiving) - TouchPoint can only store two email addresses per user.  While most
people probably only use one or two email addresses at a time, it can be helpful to keep track of all of the email addresses
someone uses across time.  This script allows many more email addresses to be immutably associated with a person's record,
making future data imports significantly less likely to produce duplicates.  This script is strongly encouraged for the 
Mailchimp and ConstantContact integrations. 

- [**Role Checker**](RoleChecker) - Automatically update the roles users have as part of the Morning Batch process.  While
this doesn't remotely handle all the roles, it does handle those that are most important for us and most likely to change.

- [**Sage Intacct**](SageIntacct) - Create a reconciliation report that readily imports into Sage Intacct, as required by
AcctTwo, our accounting firm. 

## Tools Under Development

- [**Mailchimp Sync**](Mailchimp) - Sync Mailchimp subscribers both ways (from Mailchimp to TouchPoint and vice versa), 
across multiple Mailchimp accounts and with Mailchimp Interests as TouchPoint Subgroups.

- [**Top Content Widget**](TopContentWidget) - We have an extensive resource library on our website.  This widget shows on
the TouchPoint homepage/dashboard which resources have been most popular in the last week.
